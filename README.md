#Description
This family friendly joyful shooter is both radical in its design and unique! The game approaches the shooter genre in a creative way, instead of shooting zombies or killing you as a player spray 'bloom' spray to help the weeds that are struggling to grow into beautiful flowers. They follow the player around begging for help and if the player isn't fast enough they get overgrown by the weeds. The background music is relaxing to give the player motivation to help sprout these poor weeds into joy. 

#Instructions
Use WASD keys to move around and the mouse to aim with left mouse button for the spray mechanic!
